# A Programmer's Narrative: The Birth of a Blogging System

The clamor of the world often leaves one feeling weary. I often think, if only there were a pure land where I could freely wield my pen, how liberating that would be. Yet, reality is always particularly ironic. Those platforms that claim to be free are nothing but cages of money and power. Thus, this naive programmer found the notion of building a home for myself.

## About sblog

sblog, a name that sounds rather amusing. As always, we programmers lack imagination. The "s" is probably an abbreviation for self, or perhaps a synonym for stupid. But none of that matters. What’s important is that it is ultimately my little piece of land, where my joys and sorrows can coexist.

You ask why I chose to do it myself? Aren't there already comprehensive blogging platforms out there? Indeed, just as there are already grand and complete thoughts in the world. However, have you ever seen how many souls crawl behind those glossy interfaces?

## So Many Features

sblog can be considered quite comprehensive. Article management, tag categorization, comment systems—all are included. What’s more, it even pretentiously added a "responsive design." As if that would allow it to adapt to this unpredictable world.

I also made sure to include SEO optimization. How ridiculous! A corner that no one cares about actually dares to hope to be discovered by this restless world. But then again, isn’t that a reflection of us pitiful creatures? In the vast sea of humanity, we still hope that a pair of eyes can catch a glimpse of our existence.

## The Path of Development is Also the Path of Life

The process of developing sblog feels like a microcosm of life itself. The initial ambition, the bumps along the way, and finally the compromises and persistence. I have tossed and turned over a minor bug, and I have also reveled in a clever design.

During this process, I have asked myself more than once: what is all this for? Is it to flaunt my meager skills? Or is it to find someone to confide in this noisy world?

Whenever this thought arises, I am reminded of Mr. Lu Xun's words: "Since ancient times, we have had those who work diligently, those who strive with all their might, those who speak for the people, and those who sacrifice themselves for the law... this is the backbone of China." Perhaps, this inconspicuous programmer can also be a small backbone in my little piece of land?

## To Be Continued

sblog is ultimately an immature product, much like its creator. It has a long way to go and many shortcomings to improve. But isn’t that a true reflection of life? We are always growing, always perfecting ourselves.

Perhaps one day, sblog will grow into a truly useful tool. Or maybe, like countless failures in this world, it will quietly fade away in the river of time. But what does that matter? What’s important is that in this process, we have thought, we have tried, we have lived.

If someone were to ask me what the significance of developing sblog is, I think I would answer this way: just like the meaning of a person's existence, its existence is its meaning.
